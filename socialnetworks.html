<h1>I'm not a big fan of social networks... <br/><span style="font-size: 12px">Have people forgotten how to talk in real life!?</span></h1>
<p>Facebook: I'm not on Facebook any more because I really don't like talking to people online that I no longer talk to in real life. I also don't like being advertised to based on an in depth profile of my likes, dislikes, and social circles. Oh yea -- not to mention, I don't like having social experiments conducted on me without my prior consent either. So that's basically why I'm no longer on Facebook.</p>
<p>LinkedIn: I really liked LinkedIn when it first started. It was cool to have an online address book of those professionals that I have worked with and who I could reach out to if need be. That was until LinkedIn shifted it's focus from professional address book to job board. Seriously I don't need to have five recruiters email me in one day about one job, that I didn't even show interest in.</p>
<p>MySpace: It's a great site. Have you seen it? I won't use it, but it's awesome looking.</p>
<p>G+: I think Goolge Plus is one of the most "well made" social sites out there. But since it's Google, it's safe to say the site is a ploy to feed your ad profile; Historically speaking, Google has already tried to launch something like 5 social networks to not much success. So, no thanks. (But I will reference it for my own social site builds.)</p>
<p>Everything Else: So if you're not one of the top ones above and you're not specifically servicing a niche (i.e. Github, BitBuckett, Bungie.net etc) then you fall into the "Why?" bucket. As in "Why should I use this other service instead of a major one?". Remember, a social network is only as useful as it's member-base volume which smaller unknown social sites can't compete with. So thanks, but I'll skip it.</p></div></div>
