        <h1>Let's get to know each other... <span style="font-size: 12px;">said the spider to the fly</span></h1>
        <p>I graduated from New York Institute of Technology in Manhattan in 2001 with a BFA in Communication Arts. Interned at WNBC and worked shortly in the Independent Movie scene for practically free (because everyone wants to be in the movies right!?)</p>
        <p>From this, I got a real job and started my career off at Nextel Communications (now Sprint) and General Dynamics Wireless doing Logistic, and Project Coordination work. I got certified and worked as a Project Manager for the next fifteen years in various technology disciplines.</p>
        <p>In 2010 I graduated from the Pace University Executive MBA program. Between these period I started and sold 3 websites.</p>
        <p>in 2013 I left Project Management to pursue a career in Programming. For the last year I've been a executive level team member for a travel news wire service.</p>
        <p>I'm always looking for new startup opportunities and projects. If you think I may be what you are looking for please feel free to drop me a line.</p>
        <p>If you are a recruiter sending out the same job requirement to 1000 people please leave me off your mailing list.</p>
