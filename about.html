                            <p>Former certified Technology Project Manager turned PHP developer, I have over 10 years in technology with hands on, management and subject matter expert roles.</p>
                            <p>I enjoy problem solving -- as such I'm attracted to big technology messes that I can help clean up.</p>
                            <p>PHP 5.6 is the language I'm most comfortable in, but I'm looking forward in finding an excuse to dive in to <a target=_blank href="https://golang.org/">GO</a>.</p>
                            <p>No man is an island, and as such I work well with teams; leading or being lead.</p>
