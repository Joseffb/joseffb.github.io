        <h1 class="my-title">Let's get to know each other... <br/><span class="pull-right" style="font-size: 12px; clear:right;">said the spider to the fly</span></h1>
        <br/>
        <p>I graduated from New York Institute of Technology in Manhattan in 2001 with a BFA in Communication Arts. Interned at WNBC and worked shortly in the Independent Movie scene for practically free (because everyone wants to be in the movies right!?)</p>
        <p>From this, I got a real job and started my career off at Nextel Communications (now Sprint) and General Dynamics Wireless doing Logistic, and Project Coordination work. I got certified and worked as a Project Manager for the next 10 years in various technology disciplines.</p>
        <p>A breakaway moment occurred for me in 2007 when I decided to leave the government vendor world behind and head over to the publishing and advertising industries.</p>
        <p>In 2010 I graduated from the Pace University Executive MBA program. Between these period I started and sold 3 websites.</p>
        <p>Finally around 2013 I left the Project Management track to pursue a career in Programming.</p>
        <p>For the last year I've been an executive level team member for a travel news wire service doing hands-on PHP development -- making products that bring in the money.</p>
        <p>The future looks good but I'm always looking for a new startup opportunity or pet project. If you think you may know of something that fits in my expertise feel free to drop me a line.</p>
        <p><br/><u>NOTE TO RECRUITERS</u>: I know you guys and gals out there are eager beavers and want to feed your database with as many names as possible but before you contact me make sure the job is something I like to do and am qualified for. It should not be my job to filter through 20 emails a day that end with "if you know someone who would be a fit for this position". Nope, not my job and easy way to get your IP marked as spam. Be forewarned.</p>
